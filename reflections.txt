Your response goes here!

To be honest, I have enough previous html and css experience that I don't really
that I learned anything new with this project. The only exception was that I learned
about the sup tag, and refreshed my memory on the hr tag.
I found this project to be very easy.
I didn't really encounter any difficulties in this challenge.
Since I found this project very straight-forward I didn't have to apply any of the
suggested problem solving strategies.
